// QUICK CHECK 4.1:
// 
// Q1. Give at least two examples of values that can be bound to symbols with 'let'.
// A1. Primitive values, values of custom types, functions.
//
// Q2. Whatâ€™s the difference between let and var?
// A2. Let is an immutable binding of a symbol. var represents a pointer to a specific mutable object. 
//
// Q3. Is F# a static or dynamic language?
// A3. F# is a statically typed language.

// Listing 4.4: Scopin in F#
